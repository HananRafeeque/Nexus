                <h1>About Our Sentiment Analysis Project</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews project! Our project is designed to help businesses understand customer opinions by analyzing their reviews and feedback. This system uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights for product development and marketing strategies.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>Our inspiration for this project stemmed from the need for businesses to better understand their customers' sentiments through the vast amounts of feedback they receive online. Traditional methods of manually analyzing reviews are time-consuming and prone to errors, so we developed an automated system to streamline the process.</p>
                <p>We started this project as a college assignment, aiming to create a real-time sentiment analysis tool that can dynamically identify and classify review content, even when the column name in the dataset is not predefined.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Key Features</h2>
